# RAG Chatbot Langchain ðŸ“Ž
## Overview
This repository contains the code for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot built using the LangChain framework. The chatbot leverages both generative language models and external knowledge sources to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. On top of that, streamlit is used as frontend framework to provide user interface to interact with LLM. The whole RAG application is deployed locally without any external hosting.

## What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of generative language models with the precision of information retrieval systems. The system first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and then uses a generative model to craft a response based on the retrieved information.
